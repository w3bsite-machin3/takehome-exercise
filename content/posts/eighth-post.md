Hey [Customer],
Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Could you send me a link to the repo (assuming it's public) and the build log for the site? Here's how to access your logs:

- When you click on the project from your Netlify dashboard, go to "Deploys" at the top left next to "Overview"
- Scroll down and click on the most recent build (it will probably have a tag that says "Failed")
- Once you've clicked, you'll see a summary of the most recent deploy. Scroll down to the section that says "Deploy log" (more on deploy logs [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/05/more-confident-deployments-thanks-to-netlify-deploy-summaries/))

You can just click "Copy to clipboard" and drop the whole log file into [the forum, an email]. I'll take a look at any errors I find and then should be able to offer more guidance!

Jen
