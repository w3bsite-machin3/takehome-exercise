Hey [Customer],
I'm sorry to hear that. Could you send me your logs so I can try to figure out what went wrong? Here's how to get to those:
- When you click on the project from your Netlify dashboard, go to "Deploys" at the top left next to "Overview"
- Scroll down and click on the most recent build (it will probably have a tag that says something like "Build failed")
- Once you've clicked, you'll see a bunch of information about the most recent deploy. Scroll down to the section that says "Deploy log"

You can just click "Copy to clipboard" and drop the whole log file into [the forum, an email]. I'll take a look at any errors I find and then should be able to offer more guidance!

Jen
