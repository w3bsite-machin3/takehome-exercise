[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) docs, and HashiCorp's docs in general, are great. I'll just share a few things I appreciate about them. 

### Overall design
- The table of contents panel on the left side helps me get my bearings quickly. HashiCorp docs have this feature across many different sets of product documentation.
- Having "Glossary", "Introduction to Terraform", and "Guides and Whitepapers" sections helps users understand the larger context that Terraform operates in.
- The color scheme is pretty. It matters!

### "Getting Started"
I love a "Getting Started" guide. [This one](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) has video and text so people can choose their own adventure. Helpful features include:

- progress bar that sticks to the top of the page so you can always see how far into the guide you are
- "time to complete" and "level" so you can get a sense before you go further of how much time and energy you'll have to commit
- syntax highlighting in code snippets
- a few paragraphs per heading; no walls of text
