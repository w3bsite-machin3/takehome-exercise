[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) docs, and HashiCorp's docs in general, are great. 

### Overall design
I appreciate the table of contents panel on the left side that helps me get my bearings quickly. They have this feature across many different documentation sections.

Having glossary, introduction to Terraform, and guides/whitepapers sections help users understand the larger context that Terraform operates in.

The color scheme is pretty. It matters!

### Getting started
I love a "getting started" guide. [This one](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) has video and text so people can choose their own adventure. Helpful features include:

- progress bar that sticks to the top of the page so you can always see how far into the guide you are

- "time to complete" and "level" so you can get a sense before you go further of how much time and energy you'll have to commit

- syntax highlighting in code snippets

- a few paragraphs per heading; no walls of text
