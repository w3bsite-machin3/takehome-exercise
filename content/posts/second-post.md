I’ve thought of some of my teaching work as technical support. In that setting, one of my favorite my things is contributing to someone else’s feeling of accomplishment. In JavaScript workshops I’ve taught, I’ve seen people who didn’t think of themselves as technical carry out a vision for a project and start to imagine other possibilities for the tools they learned how to use in my workshop. That can be an empowering and fun experience—I know it was for me when I was first learning to code—and I enjoy participating in that!
